# CatanCounter
Counts the dice rolls for board games w/ two dice in real time

** Read me **

I created a program to have on hand when playing catan.

Run the program and enter what the dice rolled in the terminal when prompted

A graph should appear after every entry, but will disappear after 1 second

If you make a mistake, enter y on the next prompt and it will take away your last entry
